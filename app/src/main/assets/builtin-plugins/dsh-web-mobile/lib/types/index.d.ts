/**
 * dsh-web-mobile, node half. Mostly a client UI plugin: apply() exists so the
 * plugin appears in the host Loader. It installs transparent gzip/brotli
 * compression for large JSON responses (long-session history is megabytes on
 * a phone; patches http.ServerResponse.prototype, disposer restores it), and
 * — ported from community-fork wzxmt-zhc v2.7.0 — the ONE host capability the
 * mobile drawer needs that the harness does not provide: deleting a session
 * (the host session menu only knows rename / fork / archive; archive only
 * hides a row).
 *
 * `POST /api/mobile-nav.session.delete` receives `{ sessionId }` and hands
 * the work to `deleteSession()` (see `delete-session.ts`). Services are read
 * at request time through `ctx.get()` so the row fails with a clear error
 * (never crashes) in host shapes that omit them.
 *
 * The browser half ships via exports["./client"], discovered through the
 * package.json dsh.client declaration. Host packages are intentionally NOT
 * type-imported: this repo's node_modules only carries the client-side
 * @deepseek-ai packages, so all host faces are declared structurally below.
